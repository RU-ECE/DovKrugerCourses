# Dov Kruger Bio page

Hello! I'm Dov Kruger.

I love to teach computation to students who really want to learn it. Over the years I have also taught sailing, celestial navigation, personal finance, and lately methods of lowering cholesterol. Teaching is an important part of my life.

I like exercise, but always liked sitting and programming more. It turns out that was a big mistake. Today I am much more careful to exercise and eat right.

If you are interested in joining me on a project, you should probably take one of my courses and impress me with your enthusiasm and work ethic. My projects tend to be very hands-on coding and require significant expertise.
