# Dov Kruger Research Interests

If you are interested in joining me in my research you have to know 4 things

1. At this point I have no support and cannot pay. My projects are designed to help students learn. I am working on getting some stipends for students.
2. You have to be able to do work independently. I will help you, but you must be able to make concrete progress without non-stop help.
3. In order to know you, generally I expect you to have taken one of my courses so I can see what you can do.
4. Grail requires a high degree of C++ expertise, so I would prefer if you would take EE-553 first.

## Grail

- A high speed replacement for the web. - By building everything from scratch we can make it more secure, and much, much faster.
  - When compared to browsers we have experimentally demonstrated
    - A factor of 10 to 50 in rendering speeds
    - A memory footprint 1% of current browsers
    - Factor of 1000 to 10k speedup in transactions
  - It is possible to design pages that can load in milliseconds rather than seconds.
  - Downloading less data from the server means
    - Needing fewer servers (less money)
    - Requiring less power
    - Better user experience

## Interactive Document

- Building a better assessment engine for online quizzes
- Incorporating the assessment engine into Canvas so it can be used here at Stevens
- Building a document representation that allows embedding interactive elements like quizzes and online coding mini editors directly into books
