# CPE-593 (Applied Data Structures and Algorithms)

## Install either g++ or Java

Your homework must compile either on [g++](../all/cpp.md) or [Java](../all/java.md), and the tools listed above will do that.  

You will need git, described above, in order to get the examples that I build in class each week.

There is no other required materials for this class.

You can test yourself, to see if you're prepared for this course by trying out the [self assessment](selfassess.md).
