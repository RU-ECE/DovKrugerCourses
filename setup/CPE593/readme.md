## CPE-593 (Applied Data Structures and Algorithms)

**Install either g++ or Java** as described in the sections above.
Your homework must compile either on g++ or Java, and the tools listed above will do that.  

You will need git, described above, in order to get the examples that I build in class each week.

There is no other required materials for this class.
