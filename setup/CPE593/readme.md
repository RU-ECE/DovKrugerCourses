# ECE-573 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

## Install either g++ or clang++

Your homework must compile either on [g++](../all/cpp.md), if you know rust come discuss with me. The tools listed above will do that.  

You will need git, described above, in order to get the examples that I build in class each week.

There is no other required materials for this class.

You can test yourself, to see if you're prepared for this course by trying out the [self assessment](selfassess.md).
