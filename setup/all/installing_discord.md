# Installing Discord

1. Download Discord here &rarr; <https://discord.com/download>
2. Join the shared Discord server using the [invitation link](https://discord.gg/77RJryjGMW).

If Discord does not work for the class, we will switch to zoom. So far it's been a huge success.

- Discord gives us
  - The ability to have a discussion board for each course as well as shared conversation.
  - A place where you can go to ask for help and get instant feedback from TAs and peers.
  - A standard way to share files that is better than canvas.
