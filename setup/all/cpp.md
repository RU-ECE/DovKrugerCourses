### For Using C++ in a Course

- If you use Windows [Install msys2 and git inside](installing_msys2.md)
- If you use Mac OSX, we don't have our own instructions for you
  - [Instructions for installing git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
  - [Instruction for installing c++ compiler](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/web/common/help/cpp_osx-setup.php)
  - extra credit available for anyone willing to generate high quality Mac OSX instructions
  
  Note: C++ Code must compile on g++-9 or better using the default. Since Visual Studio has a tendency to inject non-standard code, you are risking your assignments not being accepted. You may test with Visual Studio but must verify the code in g++ before submitting.
