# For Using C++ in a Course

- [Install msys2 and git](GIT101.md)
- [Instruction for installing c++ compiler](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/web/common/help/cpp_osx-setup.php)
- For Windows in msys2, install cgdb, a better version of gdb
  - ```pacman -S cgdb```
- extra credit available for anyone willing to generate high quality Mac OSX instructions

Installing C++ IDEs
A graphical debugger and IDE is extremely useful. The following are great and will help you learn. Installing multiple environments is not a bad idea.

- CLion. This is commercial but you can get a free student license which you have to renew every year [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download)
- vscode. This is great for working collaboratively with remote partners. [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - Unfortunately, vscode is complicated and has many plugins.
  - We try to make this easy by writing a script:
  - see vscode instructions
  - add codeium to help you code live
  Note: C++ Code must compile on g++ using the default. Since Visual Studio has a tendency to inject non-standard code, you are risking your assignments not being accepted. You may test with Visual Studio but must verify the code in g++ before submitting.
