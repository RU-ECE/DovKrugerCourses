# Installing Git

Git is great

- Installation and Setup
  - [Windows](#windows)
  - [Mac](#mac)
- [Using Git](#using-git)

### [← Return once done](../readme.md)

## Windows

### Everything moving forward is done in msys64 (the blue one), NOT cmd

1. Get a [github student account](https://education.github.com/pack).
2. Download git. In msys, this is

  ```bash
  pacman -S git
  ```

> Do not install the git bash on windows, just install it in msys2

3. Create a public/private key

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ```

this creates a directory .ssh in your home msys2 directory[^1]
> C:\msys64\home\yourusername\\.ssh

There will be two files: `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.
  
  *`id_rsa`* is your PRIVATE KEY. **Do not share this with anyone**.

  *`id_rsa.pub`* is your PUBLIC KEY. This is how github will know who you are.

4. Display your public key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

you should see something like:

>ssh-rsa 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 dkruger@infin

5. Apply your key.
   1. Copy this from the command line. To copy, highlight everything beginning with `ssh-rsa` and right click, copy.
   2. Log into github.com. Click on your profile (top right)
   3. Click on Settings:
   4. Add an ssh key and paste in your ***public key***. Label the key in case you have multiple computers so you can track which one is which.

6. I suggest creating a directory for git, all your git repos can go under here. You can use any tool you like, I use mkdir:

      ```bash
        mkdir ~/git
      ```

The above command creates a new directory git under your msys home directory.

At the command line, change directory so you are in the git directory:

```bash
cd ~/git
```

## Mac

1. Get a [github student account](https://education.github.com/pack).

2. Download git [on Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

3. Create a public/private key by using this command

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ```

this creates a directory .ssh in your home msys2 directory[^1]
> C:\msys64\home\yourusername\\.ssh

There will be two files: `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.
  
  *`id_rsa`* is your PRIVATE KEY. **Do not share this with anyone**.

  *`id_rsa.pub`* is your PUBLIC KEY. This is how github will know who you are.

## Using Git

Test your setup by trying to clone the repo for your class. First go to the repository on gitub.com Example: C++ 

Click on the green button and copy the SSH url (DO NOT get the HTTPS url, because if you do you will have to type your password every time, it’s a huge pain)

Clone the repository:
Examples shown for all courses

```bash
git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE553-CPP.git
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE552-Java.git
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE593.git
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE390.git
```

You now have all the code for the course in the directory. If I ever add material to the repo and push it up, all you have to do is:

change directory to get into your class repo on your computer

```bash
cd ~/git/CPE593
```

To get all the changes:

```bash
git pull
```

1. For a group project repo, such as CPE-552-Group or CPE-553-Group
    you will have to accept an invitation to join because the repo is private.

    Look for an invitation from github.com in your email or log into github and click on notifications:

2. Creating your own repo. If you were asked to create an individual repo as an assignment, you will be given a link. Clicking on this link will create a private repo that only you and your instructor and TA can see. For a group project you will need to manually create a repo. Steps:
    - One of you go to github.com/yourname.
    - Login

3. How to add others to your repo:

    - In your repo, click on Settings, then Manage Access.
    - You need to know the github ids of all parties. Give them access they need. For most members of your team, write access is enough. Admin access means they can add/remove members from the team, AND ALSO DELETE THE ENTIRE REPO.

4. Forking a repository

    - On the internet when we don’t know other people, instead of letting them have write access to your repo, they typically fork it. Forking makes a copy of your repo on github.
    - The person who forked then clones the new repo to their computer. They start working.
    - When they have something to contribute, they create a pull request, asking you (the owner of the parent repo) to take their good idea and make it part of the parent project.

5. Setting changes in a parent project to update locally: Suppose homework is posted in CPE-390hw. All students are given individual repos which fork off the parent but are private. Sometime later, the parent repo is changed to add a new homework. How do students get the new homework? You need to set your repo to update when the parent is changed as follows:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/master
    ```

|--|--|
| Getting the most recent version of a repo | git pull |
| Putting in all changes in the current directory | git add . git commit -m”comment describing the update” git push |
| git diff myfile | Display the difference between this file and the one in the repo |
| git branch -a | Show all branches in the current repo including the remote ones not pulled here |
| git status | show all the files that are changed and need to be committed |
| git merge branchname | Pull in all changes from branch into the current branch. Any files that can be automatically merged are. Files that git cannot figure out, where two edits occur on the same line have conflicts which a human must resolve. |
| git checkout branch -- filename | Replace current file(s) in this branch with the named files from another branch. This is good for pulling in files from another  branch, or just wiping out a change and pulling in the original file again |
| git checkout [hexcode of commit] | This pulls in a specific commit and makes it current, ie go back to an known time. You can get the codes by clicking on commits in github and going back through the changes until you find the one you want. |

Find out how much one author in git has been committing

```bash
git log --author="<authorname>" --oneline --shortstat
```

If you want to really learn git you can also read the manual, but that's a real book (350 pages).
