**The easiest way to use all these is with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).** I recommend Jetbrains CLion, which you can use free as a student and Qt Creator.
The best general purpose editor I have used lately is Microsoft vscode, but I have not mastered configuring it yet.

It would be worth your while to install Emacs, VI, Sublime Text 3, Atom, and Notepad++ (Windows). The more tools you know how to use, the better off you will be. These are not required for the course, however. The only requirement is that you must be able to build programs and use make/cmake for larger programs.

You will see me use some of these tools in class. **If you want to get a job programming, it is distinctly to your advantage to get as many tools as possible on your resume.**

## Using an Online Compiler

 All students are responsible to get at least one IDE working on their own computers.
 I will try to help, but I am outnumbered, and this is something you must learn to do.
 If you are having a problem getting IDEs working

- Try more than one
- Get help from a friend in class
- Get help from the graduate student support center if it is operational
- Search online for the error you are getting and whether anyone else has solved a similar problem
- Post on stackexchange.com
- Come to my office hours as a last resort
- In the meantime, you must get your homework done. This may mean using an online compiler, or using a friend's machine. Do not copy homework.
   There are a huge number of these sites.

  - [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/)
  - [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/ide)

## IDE Installation

### [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/)

- The best portable environment I know.  You will have to get a free license updated every year while a student

### [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

- You may use Visual Studio for your own purposes, but if you do not compile with g++ or clang, your code might be non-standard. If you do not submit code that compiles under g++, you will get a 25% for that assignment.
