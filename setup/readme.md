Please fully follow the instructions found in each link to properly prepare for your course.

## &rarr; [Download and Use Discord](all/installing_discord.md)

> Visual Studio Code is a very powerful and simple to use IDE. We recommend it to most students and for most applications.

## &rarr; [Download Git](all/GIT101.md)

> Git is an indispensable tool for any type of work that involves a computer and files, programming being no exception.

## &darr; Class specific Setup

[^note]: Discord is not supported by IT, and while it is vastly better in most ways than Zoom, we will use zoom if anyone has serious problems. Just let me know.
