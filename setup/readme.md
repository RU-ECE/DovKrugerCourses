# First Steps

Please fully follow the instructions found in each link to properly prepare for your course.

## &rarr; [Download and Use Discord](all/installing_discord.md)

## &rarr; [Download VSCode](all/installing_vscode.md)

> Visual Studio Code is a very powerful and simple to use IDE. We recommend it to most students and for most applications.

## &rarr; [Download Git](all/GIT101.md)

> Git is an indispensable tool for any type of work that involves a computer and files, programming being no exception.

Once you've followed all the instructions above, move on to your class.
