## About this repository

Hello! and welcome to my shared course resource site

These pages contain general information for each semester about all my courses.
Just because information is here does not mean it applies to your course.

This document is a work in progress, designed to help you get software tools you need to learn programming.
In the end, you are responsible to learn how to install tools on your own computer. If you want to help by correcting
mistakes you find, you can recommend corrections. Help is appreciated and will be awarded some extra credit.

If you have difficulty installing the tools for your course, or if a page is broken, please notify your TA or grader. They will contact me. For classes in which there is no grader, contact me with a specific location where a link is broken, or an explanation that you do not understand. It may be easiest to get on discord and show me the problem in office hours.

Extra credit will be given to people who participate in discussions in discord, both asking and answering!

### Work

Many new students in my courses need help with:

- installing programming tools
- getting to know Linux and/or bash command line
- C++
- Java
- How to use an IDE
- How to use a debugger
- Using version control (git, github)
- Using continuous integration (CI) tools

In short, there are many skills programmers need, not all taught in my classes (not enough time)
I usually have permission to hire some top students as peer mentors. If you know some of the above topics and want to help, feel free to contact me.

### Volunteers

If I cannot hire you due to lack of funds, you can still help your fellow students
[If you need help]
Depending on what funding I can get for workers, extra help may be available
Help will be available in the Graduate Student Support Center for all courses listed here.
