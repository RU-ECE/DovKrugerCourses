# Grading

Please do not contact me, TAs, or graders with any medical details of your excuse for illness. You are entitled to your privacy, and we do not wish to know.

Mapping to final letter grades will depend on the overall grades in the course.

Grades may be increased by 1% if more than 90% of students respond to the survey.

Attendance is not required, but if in-class work is handed out and graded for attendance, missing too many in-class work will make your grade ineligible for curving.

Students entitled to accommodation are welcome to take quizzes in class in regular time if they wish, they may also elect to arrange quizzes with exam accommodations with ODS. Any student with accommodations who elects to take an in-class quiz in regular time, may retake the quiz with accommodations.
