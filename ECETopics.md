# ECE Topics

## Software

- ### C++
  - Reigning king of High-performance coding for large object-oriented systems.
  - Has serious problems with memory and threading bugs. Newer languages are trying to replace and simplify
  - See [rust](#rust), [golang](#golang), [assembler](#assembler)
  - [Good Book, a bit old (new version not out yet)](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113)
  - [Online reference](https://cplusplus.com/reference/)
  - [C++ standard docs](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links)
  - [C++-23 working draft](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft)
  - Course EE-553 [Syllabi](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yr9wC807nxlcxp3ywNQiIytzMyIuNCQF)
- ### C
- ### Java
  - Simpler than C++, with protection for going out of bounds. Memory bugs are not possible, but therefore code is slower. Later compilers generate code that is almost as fast as C++ for a lot of cases such as loops and ordinary math, but the Java virtual machine (JVM) was written 25 years ago, and does not know about vector computing and other special features of newer CPUs.
  - Safe programming language used for business logic and back ends of high performance business systems
  - Simplified clean language grammar
  - Verbose
  - See [golang](#golang), [kotlin](#kotlin)
  - Definition of [Java Virtual Machine JVM]()
  - Course: [CPE-552 Java](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yr9wC807nxlcxp3ywNQiIytzMyIuNCQF)
- ### golang
- ### kotlin
- ### rust
- ### CI (Continuous Integration)
  - Testing technique where code is recompiled and tested whenever changes are made
  - github provides [actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)
- ### debugging
- ### memory sanitizer
- ### cryptography
  - symmetric cryptography
  - asymmetric cryptography
  - secure hash algorithm (SHA)
  - digital signature
- ### 
## Machine Learning

- Machine Learning
  - Defining and training a neural network to recognize complex patterns. This is the technique generally used for Aritificial Intelligence (AI) in applications today.
  - [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
  - Machine learning engines include
    - Google [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    - [Article contrasting different ML toolkits](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/machine-learning-tools/)
    - ECE Course AAI-695 Applied Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
  - Neural networks that are larger can appear more intelligent. Deeper networks are more complicated and take far longer to train. The fundamental principles are the same.
  - ECE Course AAI-628 Deep Learning

## Hardware/Embedded Systems

## Document Management

It may seem mundane, but documents are important. You should know how to use markdown (.md) the language that this document is written in for example, as it is a very common format used in documenting programming projects. And if you want to write documents with a lot of equations, you might want to know LaTeX.
 - [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
 - [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
 - [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com) Overleaf is a web-based engine that lets you type collaboritively with other people and still use LaTeX.
 - [TeXWorks](https://tug.org/texworks/) TeXWorks is an editor that is used on your own computer.
