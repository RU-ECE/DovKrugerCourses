# Git Step by Step

Git is the premier version control system, invented by Linus Torvalds of Linux fame.
You will use git to pull any changes I make to course examples, and also to work together in groups.

Git will require you to generate an ssh key in your home directory. Where that is depends on your environment
(Windows, MSYS2, Mac/Linux)

If you want to really learn git you can also read the manual, but that's a real book (350 pages).

You will also need a Github account. Github is a website that offers online hosting of git repositories. All my class examples are hosted on git, and in some cases you will be asked to submit larger homeworks using git. In any case as a programmer, this is something everyone should know.
