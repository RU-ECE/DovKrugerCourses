# FAQ For Dov Kruger’s Courses

This FAQ is designed to answer the repetitive questions I get about my courses, and to give instructions for students about to start.

All my courses are here: [DovKrugerAllCourses](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkeHB2emExaThFUlE?resourcekey=0-vc7jfyiAfUHaAAc1ZPX5rw&usp=sharing)

All course syllabi were under the above directory in a folder called courseinfo. These are now being migrated to github.

> I do not have course syllabi from 10 years ago, sorry. Current only.

[Setup Software for my courses](setup/readme.md)

Old videos for all my courses are located in a file called CourseVideos which is under the top directory.

On the first day we will go over the rules, but all the rules are in the syllabi for each course, located in the courseinfo directory. Each course has its own syllabus with the specifics of materials, but they all share a common generic syllabus file with the grading rules.

```bash
Q: Where are all the course examples from class?
```

> A: All of my courses use github to disseminate programming examples. In some classes you may be asked to clone a repository and hand in your homework in github. You can read how to use github in the following tutorial: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kSknsnRPqe1-DSIx-r9alMr1drEHzgzzXxqCkdlnHGk>

```bash
Q: You use a lot of linux tools in your courses. How do I learn that stuff?
```

> A: See [LinuxCrashCourse](https://github.com/LinuxCrashCourse)

```bash
Q: I want to take Java or C++.  I don’t have much programming background.  Can I take your class?
```

> A: There are no prerequisites for C++ or Java, but the class goes FAST.  To reduce your stress level, if you are a beginner watch some of the videos before, try to do some of the homework before.  The more you can pre-learn, the easier it will be. Most students can complete this course with 7.5 to 10 hours per week of work. A few need much more, or rather need help, because staring at your screen for 20 hours a week is not productive. Help is available if you need it, but you must actively get it.

```bash
Q: I want to take data structures but don’t know much programming. May I?
```

> A: For CPE593 Data structures, you must know either C++ or Java well.  If you do not, take a course in C++ or Java so you are prepared. You have been warned.
If you have doubts of whether you can handle the class, there is a [self assessment](selfassess.md) so you can see whether you have the skills needed.

```bash
Q: How do I know if I know C++ or Java well enough to take the data structures class?
```

> A: Take the [self assessment](setup/CPE593/selfassess.md). If you pass, you know it well enough.

```bash
Q: How do I prepare for class?
```

> A: You should try to have whatever software is specified for your class installed before class starts. If you cannot do it, help will be available once the course starts but earlier is better. Instructions for software installation is in the [README](README.md)

```bash
Q: What are your classes like?
```

> A: If you want to see, you can view some of my course videos (Java, C++, Data Structures)
By watching the videos and trying to do some homework, you can tell if the course will be too difficult for you before you take it.  Note that if you are “not sure” if you are good enough in C++ and Java to take data structures, you should definitely check first.  We have CPE552 and EE553 for just that reason.

```bash
Q: If I do badly in a quiz or test can I have a retest?
```

> A: It’s not up to you. If you do badly, that’s your problem. If a large number of people do badly, I sometimes offer them, but asking will only annoy me, it will not get you a retest.

```bash
Q: Can I do a project to make up for a bad grade.
```

> A: Most people who do badly on the tests are not capable of doing a project in the course material. Under certain conditions I will allow you to do a project which will earn you the right to take the test again, but the test will be harder than the original test. So if you are the kind of person who takes more time to absorb, and you are not a good test taker, but I can see that you are a very good programmer, and you are willing to put in significant extra work, then under limited circumstances this could give you a second chance. Most people who fail the course do not fall into this category. And this only works if you do it early. Asking me at the final if you can redo the entire semester, the answer is yes, you fail and take it again.

> For C++ and Java, I have quick reference guides which offer very brief descriptions of each technical topic (usually one page).  That’s under reference.  There are also open source or released books under reference/books.

> The current directory: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkeHB2emExaThFUlE?usp=sharing>
contains all my course information.  If you want the syllabus, look in courseinfo.  The rules for all my courses are the same, located in Generic Syllabus.  For the specific topics in each course, look at the syllabus for the course.

```bash
Q: Where are the materials for your courses
```

> A: [see the README](README.md)

```bash
Q: What support is available for me if I am struggling in your class?
```

>A: Depending on the class there is a TA, me, and possibly peer mentors funded by work study and/or vice provost Chassipis. Help is available via discord, and if you cannot use discord, via zoom or in person by appointment. [My Schedule and links for help](http://bit.ly/3n1TA2L)
