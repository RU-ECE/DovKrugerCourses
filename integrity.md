# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

### Undergraduates are subject to the honor board but professors may suggest punishment

My standard policy is that any cheating detected results in a zero for the entire assignment. In the case of a major test, this may mean that cheating makes it mathematically impossible to pass the class.

- All homework, labs, projects must be typed by you and may not be copied.
- For group homework, all people must contribute. It is cheating to take credit for code which you had no hand in creating.
- It is acceptable to get help, even line by line on homework, but
   * You must understand what you wrote by the end
   * If there is any doubt of your work, you will be asked to explain what you did. You must know the gist of it.
   * Every program submitted must contain a comment listing you as author. If you worked together, you may name multiple parties as author
   * Every program or other homework must cite any help you got, including websites, the names of people helping you, and how they helped.
   * Code must never be copied from anywhere. If you give your homework or lab to someone, and they copy it, both of you are guilty of cheating.
     You can't claim that you didn't know that they would copy it. *You should never have made it available*.
   * Putting your code out on a public repository is equivalent to giving it to everyone.
### Learning for Mastery

All students are expected to try to master the material. In an attempt to reduce stress and increase learning, retests are available.

Continued retests are subject to time constraints, and to the
instructor's opinion as to whether a given student is making
sufficient effort to warrant the extra chances.  All students are
expected to try hard on the first test, despite knowing that a retest
is available.
