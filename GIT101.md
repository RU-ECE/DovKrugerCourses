# Git instructions, step by step

1. Get a [github student account](https://education.github.com/pack)
1. Download git. If on windows in msys2 this is
  ```bash
  pacman -S git
	```
	do not install git bash on windows, just install it in msys2

	[on Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
1. Create a public/private key
  ```bash
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ```
  this creates a directory .ssh in your home directory
	* Windows c:\Users\yourid\.ssh
	* On Linux /home/yourid/.ssh
	* Mac, /Users/yourid/.ssh

  There will be two files: id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
  id_rsa is your PRIVATE KEY. Do not share with anyone
  id_rsa.pub is your PUBLIC KEY. This is how github will know who you are.

1. From now on the commands shown are in linux command line. For Windows you can do the equivalent.
Display your public key
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
for example:

ssh-rsa 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 dkruger@infin
    1. Copy this from the command line
    1. Log into github.com Click on your id (top right)
    1. Click on your icon, settings:
    1. Add an ssh key and paste in your public key. Label the key in case you have multiple computers so you can track which one is which.
1. I suggest creating a directory for git, all your git repos can go under here. You can use any tool you like, I use mkdir:
```bash
mkdir ~/git
```
The above command creates a new directory git under your home directory.

At the command line, change directory so you are in the git directory:

cd ~/git



Test your setup by trying to clone the repo for your class. First go to the repository on gitub.com Example: C++ 




Click on the green button and copy the SSH url (DO NOT get the HTTPS url, because if you do you will have to type your password every time, it’s a huge pain)



Clone the repository:
Examples shown for all courses

git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE553-CPP.git
git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE552-Java.git
git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE593.git
git clone git@github.com:StevensDeptECE/CPE390.git
You now have all the code for the course in the directory. If I ever add material to the repo and push it up, all you have to do is:

cd ~/git/CPE593	# change directory to get into your class repo on your computer
	git pull			# get all the changes (you are now up to date)

For a group project repo, such as CPE-552-Group or CPE-553-Group
you will have to accept an invitation to join because the repo is private.

Look for an invitation from github.com in your email or log into github and click on notifications:
Creating your own repo. If you were asked to create an individual repo as an assignment, you will be given a link. Clicking on this link will create a private repo that only you and your instructor and TA can see. For a group project you will need to manually create a repo. Steps:
One of you go to github.com/yourname.
Login
How to add others to your repo:
In your repo, click on Settings, then Manage Access.
You need to know the github ids of all parties. Give them access they need. For most members of your team, write access is enough. Admin access means they can add/remove members from the team, AND ALSO DELETE THE ENTIRE REPO.
Forking a repository
On the internet when we don’t know other people, instead of letting them have write access to your repo, they typically fork it. Forking makes a copy of your repo on github.
The person who forked then clones the new repo to their computer. They start working.
When they have something to contribute, they create a pull request, asking you (the owner of the parent repo) to take their good idea and make it part of the parent project.
Setting changes in a parent project to update locally: Suppose homework is posted in CPE-390hw. All students are given individual repos which fork off the parent but are private. Sometime later, the parent repo is changed to add a new homework. How do students get the new homework? You need to set your repo to update when the parent is changed as follows:
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master







Getting the most recent version of a repo
git pull
Putting in all changes in the current directory
git add .
git commit -m”comment describing the update”
git push
Display dates of last change for each branch
for k in `git branch | sed s/^..//`; do echo -e `git log -1 --pretty=format:"%Cgreen%ci %Cblue%cr%Creset" $k --`\\t"$k";done | sort
git diff myfile
Display the difference between this file and the one in the repo












git branch -a
Show all branches in the current repo including the remote ones not pulled here
git status
show all the files that are changed and need to be committed
git merge branchname
Pull in all changes from branch into the current branch. Any files that can be automatically merged are. Files that git cannot figure out, where two edits occur on the same line have conflicts which a human must resolve.
git checkout branch -- filename
Replace current file(s) in this branch with the named files from another branch. This is good for pulling in files from another  branch, or just wiping out a change and pulling in the original file again
git checkout [hexcode of commit]
This pulls in a specific commit and makes it current, ie go back to an known time. You can get the codes by clicking on commits in github and going back through the changes until you find the one you want.



Find out how much one author in git has been committing
git log --author="<authorname>" --oneline --shortstat

If you Create a Git repo without ssh
git remote set-url origin <your github repo>

Remote login via ssh
ssh 155.246.33.99		log into some remote computer on the internet
ssh dov@155.246.33.99	log into the remote computer with user id dov


in order not to have to type in passwords:
generate an ssh public/private key pair if you have not already done so. If you want to use separate passwords for each site, you will need to generate a different name file

ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/thisfile

It's good practice to use separate private/public key sets for different realms anyway, like one set for your personal use, one for your work, etc.

First, generate two separate keypairs, one for home and one for work:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.work

Next, add an entry to your ~/.ssh/config file to pick the key to use based on the server you connect to:

Host home Hostname home.example.com IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home User <your home acct> Host work Hostname work.example.com IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.work User <your work acct>


copy the public key you just created to the authorized list on the remote computer:

ssh-copy-id user@remote

This will ask for your password, copy thisfile.pub to the remote computer

ssh user@remote

you now can log in with no password to remote.
