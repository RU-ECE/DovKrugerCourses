## Effective Presentations
* Do not read your slides!
  * When presenting in person and on a shared screen like zoom, DO NOT POINT AT THE SCREEN (use your mouse)
* Start by introducing yourself and/or your team
  * In general, do not mention yourselves after the introduction
  * The presentation is about a topic, not about the researchers
  * Avoid description of the process. The results are important
* After intro first topic should be a clear overview
  * Pick a clear title that makes the problem as clear as possible
  * State the problem (do not assume your audience knows it)
  * State the approaches you took in the research
* Know your audience
  * If your audience knows a term, then use it
  * If your audience is not expected to know a term, define it
    * If there is no time, the handout (see below) is an excellent place to put this
* Have slides that show the highlights, not every word
  * Have slides that show the sequence of the talk
    * If you are talking for a long time with one non-detailed slide, something is wrong
  * Consider Edward Tufte's take on powerpoint being evil, the source of bad thinking.
    * While perhaps not right for all cases, he has a point: [Tufte: Conitive Style of Powerpoint](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint)
* Mechanics of a presentation
  * Look at the audience (not the screen behind you!
  * If you need a screen, try to have it in front of you
* Have a handout
  * If there is dead time waiting to get started, invite the audience to read a one-page handout [Tufte: Handouts](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/)
* Test the room and screen to be presented
   * Come early, make sure the projector works/with your computer
   * Visibility/Accessability
      * Make sure that the font sizes are visible for the room
      * Ideally use large font sizes originally
      * Avoid Red/Green and other colors that are invisible to colorblind (10% of men)
* Speak slowly and clearly 
* When dealing with complex concepts, if a diagram can clarify, then include a diagram
   * Cite all diagrams if you use them from the internet
   * Make sure diagrams do not have features too small for the audience to see
   * Use scalable drawings (ex SVG, scalable PDF) not a bitmap
   * Do not use a jpeg for line drawings (blurring)
   * Consider accessibility of your presentation to the blind
* Have links to details for anyone who wants to drill down

* Feedback
  * In order to improve, ask people in the audience (after the talk) for feedback on how you could have improved.
  * This is a process. Very few of us give perfect presentations. Keep working on it!

## Ineffective Presentations
* Many of us have verbal ticks that distract from the material. The success of your presentation depends on how much you can eliminate these
  * When we are nervous, we tend to speak too quickly
    * Consciously try to relax. Breath before and to some extent during the presentation.
    * Practice in advance so you can gain familiarity with what you are going to say
    * Get feedback from a practice audience when possible.
  * Watch a video of yourself. Try to eliminate verbals ticks
    * Hesitation words (um, uh)
    * Phrases with zero information content
      * You know,
      * In simple terms
      * As we can see...
      * Actually
      * It is evident that... (if it is, don't say it)
      * As you know (if they know, say nothing. If they might not, don't say this)
    * Body ticks
      * Touching your face, hair, etc
      * Putting hands in pockets
      * Practice stilling your body so the audience can focus on your words.
    * Remember, most of us cannot eliminate all our ticks, but by preparation and trying, you can improve.

## Cognitive Tricks
* When dealing with a complex abstract concept
  * State the concept
  * Give a positive, concrete example of the concept
  * Give a negative, concreate example of the concept
  * Ask a question so students can measure whether they correctly understand the concept
* Punctuation with a bit of humor can be effective to make a talk memorable
  * Requires that there not be too much humor. Must be punctuated or it loses its impact.
